# **NYC CitiBike Challenge**
## **Overview**
The purpose of this analysis is to provide data regarding the New York City CitiBike business model, in order to assess the viability of recreating the business plan in another city. 

**A link to my Tableau Database can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/NSQ787R48?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

## **Results**
The below results show a number of analytica visualizations of ride data, breaking down duration, age, gender, customer type and bike utilization. 

**1. Top Starting Locations**
CitiBike bike's are used throughout New York City, with ride frequency and total number of rides ranging up to approximately 16,500 rides. As you can see by the map below, 
the majority of rides are clustered in the Manhattan area, however, we still see a range of rides throughout the entire island.

**2. Trips by Weekday by Hour** 
The frequency of rides per day and hour varies, however, we see our highest rates of trops clustered in the mornings and early evenings on weekdays, indicating that many of our 
riders are utilizing bikes during peark traffic hours.

**3. Number of Trips**
The peak number of trips for our CitiBike users is typically highest in the early to mid morning and early to mid evening, as shown below.

**4. Average Trip Duration**
As seen by the chart below, CitiBike riders span a range of ages, from 15 to over 100! Age has not slowed them down one bit, and in fact, some of the more seasoned riders have 
fairly impressive ride times. However, the majority of riders will be young to middle age.

**5. Trips by Gender (Weekdays per Hour)**
In addition to a range of ages, we also see a range of genders who utilize CitiBikes. Though, as seen in the heatmap below, the majority of riders of CitiBikes are male.

**6. User Trips by Gender by Type**
There could also be a correlation between gender and frequent customer types. As seen below, our highest customer types are Male Subscribers. It could be beneficial to 
target future marketing for this group, as it could produce the highest yield.

**7. Checkout Times for Users**
On average, riders utilize bikes for less than one hour, and most frequently between 2 and 13 minutes, so the bike wear is minimal per user.

**8. Checkout Times by Gender**
You can see a similar view of ride duration, broken down by gender.

**9. Bike Utilization**
As further demonstrated, the majority of bikes maintain minimal use, with only a select number of bikes experiencing a high level of use per ride. 
This will help us understand overall wear of the product, and minimize maintenance fees.

## **Summary**

*High-Level*
- At a glance, the CitiBike model is recommended to recreate in another large city, given the volume of ridership throughout the area. For a different city, especially one with lower all around traffic rates, however, you might consider the scale and number of bikes available and cluster them only in areas with large traffic rates, versus throughout the entire area. 

*Additional Visualizations and Recomendations*
1. I might also look at a visualization that measures trip duration compared to count and location to assess clusters of usage, since in a different city, it might be beneficial to target areas more closely than in a city like NYC.
2. Additionally, I'd create a heatmap to show the correlation between location and trips by Weekday to see if there are certain days and location where bike availability should be optimized.
